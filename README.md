# Start Here

If you've followed a link to this repo, but are not really sure what it contains
or how to use it, head over to http://hybrid-cloud-patterns.io/industrial-edge/
for additional context before continuing.

# Prerequisites

1. An OpenShift cluster ( Go to https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create )
1. (Optional) A second OpenShift cluster
1. A github account (and a token for it with repos permissions, to read from and write to your forks)
1. A quay account with the following repos set as public:
- http-ionic
- httpd-ionic
- iot-anomaly-detection
- iot-consumer
- iot-frontend
- iot-software-sensor
5. The helm binary, see https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

The use of this blueprint depends on having at least one running Red Hat
OpenShift cluster. It is desirable to have a cluster for deploying the data
center assets and a seperate cluster(s) for the factory assets.

If you do not have a running Red Hat OpenShift cluster you can start one on a
public or private cloud by using [Red Hat's cloud
service](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create).

# How to deploy

1. Fork the [manuela-dev](https://github.com/hybrid-cloud-patterns/manuela-dev) repo on GitHub.  It is necessary to fork this repo because the GitOps framework will push tags to this repo that match the versions of software that it will deploy.
1. Fork this repo on GitHub. It is necessary to fork because your fork will be updated as part of the GitOps and DevOps processes.

1. Clone the forked copy of this repo.

   ```
   git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:your-username/industrial-edge.git
   ```

1. Create a local copy of the Helm values file that can safely include credentials

  DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE

  You do not want to push personal credentials to GitHub.
   ```
   cp values-secret.yaml.template ~/values-secret.yaml
   vi ~/values-secret.yaml
   ```

1. Customize the deployment for your cluster

   ```
   vi values-global.yaml
   git add values-global.yaml
   git commit values-global.yaml
   git push
   ```

1. Preview the changes
   ```
   make show
   ```

1. Login to your cluster using oc login or exporting the KUBECONFIG

   ```
   oc login
   ```

   or

   ```
   export KUBECONFIG=~/my-ocp-env/datacenter
   ```

1. Apply the changes to your cluster

   ```
   make install
   ```

1. Check the operators have been installed

   ```
   UI -> Installed Operators
   ```

1. Obtain the ArgoCD urls and passwords

   The URLs and login credentials for ArgoCD change depending on the pattern
   name and the site names they control.  Follow the instructions below to find
   them, however you choose to deploy the pattern.

   Display the fully qualified domain names, and matching login credentials, for
   all ArgoCD instances:

   ```
   ARGO_CMD=`oc get secrets -A -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"oc get -n "}{.metadata.namespace}{" routes; oc -n "}{.metadata.namespace}{" extract secrets/"}{.metadata.name}{" --to=-\\n"}{end}' | grep gitops-cluster`
   eval $ARGO_CMD
   ```

   The result should look something like:

   ```

   ```


1. Check all applications are synchronised

# Deploying the factory applications

Once the data center has been setup correctly and confirmed to be working, it is time to attach one or more factories to the architecture (see diagrams below).

For instructions on deploying the factory please read the following [document](http://hybrid-cloud-patterns.io/industrial-edge/factory/).

# Pattern Layout and Structure

https://slides.com/beekhof/hybrid-cloud-patterns

# Uninstalling

**Probably wont work**

1. Turn off auto-sync

   `helm upgrade manuela . --values ~/values-secret.yaml --set global.options.syncPolicy=Manual`

1. Remove the ArgoCD applications (except for manuela-datacenter)

   a. Browse to ArgoCD
   a. Go to Applications
   a. Click delete
   a. Type the application name to confirm
   a. Chose "Foreground" as the propagation policy
   a. Repeat

1. Wait until the deletions succeed

   `manuela-datacenter` should be the only remaining application

1. Complete the uninstall

   `helm delete manuela`

1. Check all namespaces and operators have been removed
